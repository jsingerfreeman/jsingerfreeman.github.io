```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
I believe that  the coolest thing I've learned about programming in R this semester is the long wide format.  The following is an example. 

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
data(mtcars)



long.data_num<-mtcars%>%pivot_longer(-vs,names_to="variables",values_to="value")
library(rstatix )

#Simultaneous Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (variables are not normally distributed)
wilcox_test <- long.data_num %>%
  group_by(variables) %>%
  wilcox_test(value ~ vs)%>%
  adjust_pvalue(method = "BH") %>%
   add_significance()

wilcox_test

```
