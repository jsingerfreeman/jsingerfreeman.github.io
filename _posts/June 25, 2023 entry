In Project 1 for ST 558 (link above) I created a small vignette showing functions to extractinformation from the polygon.io API.   I ask the user for a an initial data and a following period of time.  
For the initial date I obtain the 5 most heavily-traded equity securities and certain financial information for them.   
I then obtain financial information for those top 5 securities for the provided range of daates. 
I also performed some exploratory data analysis.  Interestigly, one of the most heavily traded securies for the first quarter was SPY (the S&P 500 ETF).  Other stocks were not surprising (Tesla, Nvidia, Apply an AMD).
Also, I found that the daily transaction to volume ratio is volatile for individual stocks, but volume and number of transactions are highly correlated overall. 
The most difficult part of the assignment was the graphing and thinking about what types of analyses to perform, given that the data available in polygon
without a subscription wasn't very interesting.  
In the future, I hope to find a more interesting subject.  Unfortunately, 3 of the APIs in the requires list no longer existed.
