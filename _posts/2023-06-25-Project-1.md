My  first project for ST 558 can be found at:  [Project 1](https://github.com/jsingerfreeman/558Project1.git)

**Purpose**  In this project I created a small vignette showing functions to extract information from the polygon.io API.   I ask the user for a an initial data and a following period of time.  

**What did I do?** For the initial date I obtained the 5 most heavily-traded equity securities and certain financial information for them.   
I then obtain financial information for those top 5 securities for the provided range of daates. 

**(semi-) Interesting findings** I also performed some exploratory data analysis.  Interestigly, one of the most heavily traded securies for the first quarter was SPY (the S&P 500 ETF).  Other stocks were not surprising (Tesla, Nvidia, Apply an AMD).

Also, I found that the daily transaction to volume ratio is volatile for individual stocks, but volume and number of transactions are highly correlated overall. 

**Difficulties**  The most difficult part of the assignment was the graphing and thinking about what types of analyses to perform, given that the data available in polygon without a subscription wasn't very interesting.  

**Lessons** In the future I hope to find a more interesting subject, in particular, I would have been interested in working on the COVID API, but it was no longer functional.
