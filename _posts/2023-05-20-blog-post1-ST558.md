1. **What do you think being a data scientist is about?**  

It looks like the role of data scientist is not well defined.  The commmon thread accross the assigned readingd is that  data scientist is  someone who can collect, store and clean large amounts of data  
so that they can use the tools of statistics and computer science, as well as domain knowledge, to make predictions and answer questions from this data.  

2. **What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?**  

Based on assigned article written by Andrew Zol, duties can include: 
 - Research and develop statistical models for analysis
-  Communicate results and statistical concepts to key business leaders
-  Use appropriate databases and project designs to optimize joint development efforts
Develop custom data models and algorithms
  -  Build processes and tools to help monitor and analyze performance and data accuracy
-  Use predictive modeling to enhance and optimize customer experiences, revenue generation, ad targeting, and more
-  Develop company A/B testing framework and test model quality

A data scientist's knowlege areas may include statistics,  programming, algorithms, data manipulation, machine learning, data visualization, and domain knowledge. 

3.  **What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?**

  Although the distictions are somewhat blurred: 
-  Statisticians tend to focus more on quantifying uncertainty (inference). 
-  Data scientists are more interested that a model that predicts well.
-  The nomenclature used by these areas tends to differ somewhat
  
4.  **How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?**  
I can be either one.  At the moment I'm more interested in learning statistical methods.
