### *What would I have done differently?*  

I failed to exclude certain non-essential files from uploading to github.  As a result, I spent too much time working around the github limit on file size (e.g., LFS add on), instead of just adding the large file to the "gitinclude"  exclusions. 

### *What was the most difficult part for me?*  

Two tasks were hard.  The first, handling the gitlab interface.  The second, figuring out that I needed a separate file to render the automated production of the 6 .Rmd files. 

### *Big takeaways from this project:*  

Github may be useful, but is clunky

Caret is great!
