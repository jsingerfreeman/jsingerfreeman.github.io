### *Current thoughts  in terms of using R for data science - do I think I'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?*  

I am already using what I learned in R in this course in my internship, which will continue beyond the Summer.  I find it very useful, especially the flexibility in modifying the models and how close the code is to the statistics I learned.  
The only issue I see is that the output is harder to get and datasets are harder to manipulate thatn in SAS.  Still it's worth it.   

### *What things am I  going to do differently in practice now that I've had this course*  

I would like to use Shiny, which I learned for the first time.  I don't see an immediate application, but I'm sure I'll find something fun. 

### *What areas of statistics/data science am I thinking about exploring further?*

Although machine learning is cool, I would like to explore causation and biostatisitcs.
