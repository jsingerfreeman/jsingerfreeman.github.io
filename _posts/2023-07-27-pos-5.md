### *Current thoughts  in terms of using R for data science - do I think I'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?*  

I am already using the R I  learned in this course in my summer internship, which will continue beyond the summer, including preparation of a poster showing the predictions of various machine learning models.  I find R  very useful, especially how easy it is to generate distributions and models.   The only issue I see with R is that the output is harder to get and datasets are harder to manipulate than in SAS and if I end up working for a CRO/pharma they may use only SAS.  Still R is worth it!   

### *What things am I  going to do differently in practice now that I've had this course*  

I would like to use Shiny, which I learned for the first time.  I don't see an immediate application, but I'm sure I'll find a fun project. 

### *What areas of statistics/data science am I thinking about exploring further?*

Although machine learning is cool, I would like to explore causation and biostatisitcs.  I am just starting my Masters (I take a course per semester) so it's a sequential search for what I like...
